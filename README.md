Most of my logic is done in the PlayScreen class

If you can figure out how to change my controller.isdownpressed to something similar to "Gdx.input.isKeyJustPressed(KEY)" because 
iskeyJustPressed makes it so the key is only pressed once...isdownpressed presses it a bunch of times.. if we can figure that out
i can put my double jump back in
